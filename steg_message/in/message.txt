I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake and felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake, knowing history has its eyes on me (Whoa, whoa)
History has its eyes on me (Whoa, whoa, yeah)

Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control who lives, who dies, who tells your story
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in, history has its eyes on you (Whoa, whoa)
History has its eyes on you
